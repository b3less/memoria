# Memoria

Memoria is a system for saving and referencing fictional concepts in RP environments to create more personalized and immersive experiences.

## How it Works

The system works by allowing RP models to save fictional concepts, or "memz", locally on their machines. These memz can be referenced later by the model to create more personalized and immersive experiences for the users.

Users can also edit these memz in a wiki-like fashion, allowing for easy customization and refinement of the concepts over time. The model is designed to know when to reference a particular memz class, either at random or when something is explicitly referenced by the user.
